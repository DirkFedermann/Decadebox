# Decadebox
Schematic and PCB files for a decade box for electronic prototyping.

Base of it is a Decimal/BCD Pushwheel switch from Aliexpress.
Search terms you might want to try are: `Decimal` `BCD` `Pushwheel` `switch` `KM1`
There are AFAIK 3 sizes. These PCBs are made for the middle size KM1.

BCD (Binary-coded decimal) version is used for a capacitor decade box.
Decimal version is used for a resistor decade box.

All files a made using [Kicad](https://www.kicad.org/)
and Gerber files are exported for [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) with the option "Remove Order Number" to "Specify a location".
